	<div class="entry-content">
	  <p>
	  The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a
	  robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit
	  implementing the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure
	  Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) protocols as well as a full-strength
	  general purpose cryptography library. The project is managed
	  by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet
	  to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its
	  related documentation.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed by Eric
	  Young and Tim Hudson. The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an
	  Apache-style licence, which basically means that you are free to
	  get and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes subject
	  to some simple license conditions. 
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Please remember that export/import and/or use of strong
	  cryptography software, providing cryptography hooks, or even just
	  communicating technical details about cryptography software is
	  illegal in some parts of the world. So when you import this
	  package to your country, re-distribute it from there or even
	  just email technical suggestions or even source patches to the
	  authors or other people you are strongly advised to pay close
	  attention to any laws or regulations which apply to
	  you. The authors of openssl are not liable for any violations
	  you make here. So be careful, it is your responsibility.
