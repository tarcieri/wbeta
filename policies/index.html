	    <p>
	    In this section we try to document as many of our
	    policies and procedures as possible.
	    We do this for two reasons:  first, we want to
	    to make sure everyone knows how the project is run.
	    For example, when we announce a forthcoming fix for
	    a high-severity bug, the
	    <a href="secpolicy.html">Security Policy</a> explains
	    what that means. Second, it helps us be consistent.
	    For example, the <a href="releasestrat.html">Release Strategy</a>
	    puts out a public record of when, and how long, various
	    releases will be supported.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Put another way, by being as transparent as possible,
	    we hope to reduce the chance that people are surprised by
	    what the project does, and we hope to help maintain consistent
	    behavior within the project.
