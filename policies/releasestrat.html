	  <p>
	  As of release 1.0.0 the OpenSSL versioning scheme was improved
	  to better meet developers' and vendors' expectations. Letter
	  releases, such as 1.0.1a, exclusively contain bug and security
	  fixes and no new features. Minor releases that change the
	  last digit, e.g. 1.0.1 vs. 1.0.2, can and are likely to
	  contain new features, but in a way that does not break binary
	  compatibility. This means that an application compiled and
	  dynamically linked with 1.0.0 does not need to be recompiled
	  when the shared library is updated to 1.0.2. It should be
	  noted that some features are transparent to the application
	  such as the maximum negotiated TLS version and cipher suites,
	  performance improvements and so on. There is no need to
	  recompile applications to benefit from these features.</p>

	  <p>Binary compatibility also allows other possibilities. For
	  example, consider an application that wishes to utilize
	  a new cipher provided in a specific 1.0.x release, but it
	  is also desirable to maintain the application in a 1.0.0
	  context.  Customarily this would be resolved at compile time
	  resulting in two binary packages targeting different OpenSSL
	  versions. However, depending on the feature, it might be
	  possible to check for its availability at run-time, thus cutting
	  down on the maintenance of multiple binary packages. Admittedly
	  it takes a certain discipline and some extra coding, but we
	  would like to encourage such practice. This is because we
	  want to see later releases being adopted faster, because new
	  features can improve security.</p>

	  <p>With regards to current and future releases the OpenSSL
	  project has adopted the following policy:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Support for version 0.9.8 will cease on 2015-12-31. No
	    further releases of 0.9.8 will be made after that
	    date. Security fixes only will be applied to 0.9.8 until
	    then.</li>
	    <li>Support for version 1.0.0 will cease on 2015-12-31. No
	    further releases of 1.0.0 will be made after that
	    date. Security fixes only will be applied to 1.0.0 until
	    then.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>We may designate a release as a Long Term Support (LTS)
	  release. LTS releases will be supported for at least five years
	  and we will specify one at least every four years. Non-LTS
	  releases will be supported for at least two years.</p>

	  <p>As implied by the above paragraphs, during the final year
	  of support, we do not commit to anything other than security
	  fixes. Before that, bug and security fixes will be applied
	  as appropriate.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Version 1.0.1 will be supported until 2016-12-31.</li>
	    <li>Version 1.0.2 will be supported until 2019-12-31.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>At this time, we are not planning a 1.0.3 release.</p>

	  <p>Version 1.1.0 will (moderately) break source compatibility
	  (for example we will make most structures opaque etc). We
	  expect a preview version to be available mid 2015, with an
	  expected release by the end of 2015. Preview means that we
	  are not planning or expecting major API changes between the
	  preview release and the final release (but are not categorically
	  precluding that possibility).</p>
