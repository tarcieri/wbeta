	  This document is intended to outline the OpenSSL project
	  roadmap. It is a living document and is expected to change
	  over time. Objectives and dates should be considered
	  aspirational.</p>
	  <p>
	  The OpenSSL project is increasingly perceived as slow-moving
	  and insular. This roadmap will attempt to address this by
	  setting out some objectives for improvement, along with
	  defined timescales.</p>

	  <h2><a name="current">Current Issues</a></h2>
	  <p>
	  The OpenSSL project is currently experiencing a number of issues.
	  These are:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li><em>RT Backlog</em><br/>
	    Over a period of some considerable time open tickets have
	    been building up in RT (our bug tracking system) to the
	    point that now there are a very significant number of
	    them. A large proportion of these issues have been open
	    for years. Some of these have in fact been dealt with and
	    should be closed, but this has not been recorded in the
	    system. Most however have not been looked at.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Incomplete/incorrect documentation</em><br/>
	    Documentation of OpenSSL is patchy at best. Some areas are
	    well documented, while many others suffer from incomplete
	    or incorrect documentation. There are also many areas
	    which have no documentation at all.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Library complexity</em><br/>
	    The OpenSSL libraries and applications are complex,
	    both from a maintainer's perspective and from a user's
	    perspective. The public API contains many things which
	    should probably be internal. The code has been ported
	    to a large number of platforms, many of which are no
	    longer relevant to us today, and this complicates the
	    codebase. Some parts of the code have been in place for
	    a very long time, and are in need of a refresh. It is
	    further complicated by the support for FIPS.
	    This complexity causes maintenance problems, and
	    can also be the source of obscure and difficult to spot
	    security vulnerabilities. It can also make users' lives
	    much more difficult especially when combined with (2)
	    above.
	    The current memory management code has
	    also been a source of problems and vulnerabilities.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Inconsistent coding style</em><br/>
	    There have been numerous developers working on the codebase
	    over many years. There are many different styles used within
	    the code, which is confusing and makes maintenance more
	    difficult than it should be. Even if strictly consistent,
	    the current code layout is unusual and idiosyncratic and
	    unlike any other open source software.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Lack of code review</em><br/>
	    We don't have a code review system and we don't mandate code
	    reviews.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>No clear release plan</em><br/>
	    Historically OpenSSL has made new feature releases on
	    an infrequent basis and no forward plan of releases has
	    been published. It is difficult for users to plan for new
	    releases, and understand when new features might become
	    available, or when support will end for a release. In
	    addition a large number of stable releases are maintained
	    by the OpenSSL development team - diverting effort away
	    from the most up to date versions.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>No clear platform strategy</em><br/>
	    Historically OpenSSL has supported a very wide range of
	    platforms. Typically platform support has been added through
	    &quot;ifdef&quot; conditional compilation on a per platform
	    basis. This approach has led to a number of problems:
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	      The code has become very cluttered and is difficult to
	      effectively maintain</li>
	      <li>
	      There is support still in the code for a number of legacy
	      platforms which are unlikely to be widely deployed today -
	      if the code even still works on those platforms</li>
	      <li>
	      In practice the development team do not have access to many of
	      the platforms that the codebase supports and testing typically
	      takes place on a very limited set (usually Linux, FreeBSD and
	      Windows)</li>
	    </ul>
	    <del>
	      <li>
	      <em>No published security strategy</em><br/>
	      We do not have a well-known and published approach for how we
	      appropriately inform all interested parties of security
	      advisories.</li>
	    </del>
	  </ol>

	  <p></p>

	  <h2><a name="objectives">Objectives</a></h2>
	  <p>
	  Each of the issues identified above can be translated into
	  high level objectives. Some of these objectives can be
	  achieved more easily and quickly than others.</p>
	  <p>
	  <em>An important principle is that the priority and focus of
	    effort will be on achieving these objectives over and above
	    the delivery of new features.</em></p>

	  <h3>RT Backlog</h3>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	    Manage all newly submitted RT tickets in a timely
	    manner such as an initial response within four working
	    days. (Timescale: Now)</li>
	    <li>
	    Reduce over time the existing RT backlog (Timescale:
	    Ongoing). This may include the mass closure of very old
	    tickets, such as those raised before the release of any
	    currently supported version.
	    <p><em>Update (8th September 2014)</em>:
	    we have made a great deal of progress on the backlog.
	    A <a href="ticket-activity.png">graph of ticket activity</a>
	    is available, as is the <a href="buglist.txt">raw data</a>
	    for every bug showing when it was open, and resolved. We
	    will update these files periodically.</p></li>
	  </ol>

	  <h3>Incomplete/incorrect documentation</h3>
	   <ol>
	     <li>
	     Provide complete documentation for all of the public
	     API (excluding deprecated APIs) (Timescale: Within one year).
	     </li>
	     <li>Some parts of the API have historically been public but were
	     not intended for public use, such as low level cipher and digest
	     APIs. These parts may not be documented, and if they are will be
	     marked as deprecated (Timescale: within nine months).</li>
	     <li>This may include introducing a new documentation system.</li>
	   </ol>

	  <h3>Library complexity</h3>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	    Review and revise the public API with a view to reducing complexity
	    (Timescale: Within one year)</li>
	    <li>
	    Document a platform strategy: see below (Timescale: Within three
	    months)</li>
	    <li>
	    <del>Review and refactor the FIPS code to make it far less
	    intrusive (Timescale: Within one year)</del>
	    <br>Objective met (2015): The FIPS code has been removed from the
	    master branch, and will be re-integrated more cleanly during
	    a future validation.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <del>Review and refactor the memory management code.
	    (Timescale: Within six months)</del>
	    <br>Objective met (2015): All use of dynamic memory allocation has
	    been cleaned up and made consistent, and the internal memory
	    pool has been removed.
	    </li>
	  </ol>

	  <h3>Inconsistent coding style</h3>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	    Define a clear coding standard for the project. This will cover not
	    only code layout but also items such as how to handle platform
	    dependencies, unit testing and optional code. (Timescale: Within
	    three months).</li>
	    <li>
	    <del>Format the entire codebase according to the agreed standard.
	    (Timescale: Within three months of coding standard being
	    defined).</del>
	    <br>Objective met (2015): All release branches were
	    reformatted using a script included in the release.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    Refactor code to follow other parts of the style guide. (Timescale:
	    Within one year)</li>
	  </ol>

	  <h3>Code review</h3>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	    <del>
	      Agree and implement a process such that all new commits
	      should first be reviewed by a team member conversant
	      with the relevant code and updated until the reviewer's
	      issues are addressed. This is contingent on recruiting
	      sufficient team members that reviewers are more-or-less
	      always available. (Timescale: Within three months)
	    </del>
	    <br>Objective met (16th July 2014): All changes are first reviewed by 
	    another team member prior to being committed to the public openssl 
	    repository.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <del>
	      Agree on a code review system. (Timescale: Within six months)
	    </del>
	    <br>Objective met (2015): We use
	    <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>.
	    </li>
	  </ol>

	  <h3>Audit</h3>
	  <p>
	  Externally audit the current code base. (Timescale: Dependent on
	  external body)</p>
	  <p>Update (14th October 2014):
	  Auditors selected and funded; schedule being worked on.</p>

	  <h3>Static/Dynamic Analysis</h3>
	  <p>
	  Regularly audit the code using appropriate analysis tools.
	  (Timescale: Within six months)
	  </p>

	  <h3>Release Strategy</h3>
	  <del>
	  <p>
	  We intend to develop a release strategy which will set out our plans
	  for how frequently we plan to release, and when. It will also cover
	  how long releases will be supported for, and when their EOL (End Of
	  Life) will be. (Timescale: Within three months)</p>
	  <p>
	  There are a number of objectives that we would be seeking to address
	  within the release strategy. Some of these objectives compete with
	  each other, and so from necessity there will have to be compromises.
	  The objectives are:
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	    We need security fix releases with very low chance of breaking
	    anything. This is largely met by prohibiting new features in stable
	    branches (i.e. letter releases).</li>
	    <li>
	    If something is broken in a release a fixed version should be made
	    available shortly afterwards (i.e. more letter releases more
	    often)</li>
	    <li>
	    We need a way to get new binary compatible features into OpenSSL
	    relatively quickly.</li>
	    <li>
	    We don't want to have to maintain too many branches. This is likely
	    to include a timescale for the EOL of version 0.9.8</li>
	    <li>
	    We need a way to refactor code and make necessary binary
	    incompatible changes, deprecating APIs etc.</li>
	  </ol>
	  </del>
	  Objective met (2015): We have announced a
	  <a href="releasestrat.html">release strategiy</a>
	  which includes end-of-life and long-term support definitions.
	  Also, our
	  <a href="secpolicy.html">security policy</a> has relevant
	  information.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Platform Strategy</h3>
	  <p>
	  Moving forward OpenSSL will adopt the following policy:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	    There will be a defined set of primary platforms. The primary
	    platforms will be Linux and FreeBSD. A primary platform is one where
	    most development occurs.</li>
	    <li>
	    In addition there will be a list of secondary platforms which are
	    supported by the development team.</li>
	    <li>
	    Platform specific code will be moved out of the main codebase
	    (removing overuse of &quot;ifdef&quot;).</li>
	    <li>
	    Legacy platforms that are unlikely to have wide deployment will be
	    removed from the code.</li>
	    <li>
	    Non-supported platforms requiring regular maintenance activities
	    will eventually be removed from the code after first seeking
	    community owners to support the platforms in platform specific
	    repositories.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	  Necessary criteria for a platform to be included in the secondary
	  platform list includes:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	    Currency, i.e. a platform is widely deployed and in current use</li>
	    <li>
	    Vendor support</li>
	    <li>
	    Available to the dev team, i.e. the dev team have access to a
	    suitable environment in which to test builds and deal with tickets
	    and issues</li>
	    <li>
	    Dev team ownership, i.e. at least one person on the team is willing
	    to take some responsibility for a platform.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	  In addition the secondary list will be as small as possible so as not
	  to spread the development team too thinly.</p>
	  <p>
	  The secondary platforms are still to be defined but will be based on
	  the above criteria. For each primary/secondary platform, we should
	  have, at least, a continuous integration box and a dev machine we can
	  access for test/debug. We will seek support from the platform vendors
	  or the community to provide access to these platforms. The secondary
	  platform list will change over time, but an initial list will be
	  produced within three months.</p>
	  <p>
	  The Platform Strategy will be phased in over a period of time based
	  on how quickly we can refactor the code.</p>

	  <h3>Security Strategy</h3>
	  <p>
	  <del>
	    We will be documenting a security strategy which will define our
	    policy on how we make security fixes, and what (if any)
	    pre-notification of forthcoming security releases will be provided
	    (and to whom) (Timescale: Within two months)
	  </del>
	  <br>Objective met (7th September 2014): The OpenSSL security policy
	  is available <a href="secpolicy.html">here</a>.
	  </p>

	  <h2><a name="forthcoming">Forthcoming Features</a></h2>
	  <p>The primary focus of effort will be on achieving the
	  objectives detailed above, however we are evaluating the following
	  new features.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>IPv6 support</li>
	    <li>AEAD updates (API review, Poly/ChaCha support, /dev/crypto
	    operations coalescing)</li>
	    <li>TLS 1.3.</li>
	    <li>Certificate Transparency support</li>
	    <li>Support for new ciphersuites e.g., CCM</li>
	    <li>Extended SSL_CONF support</li>
	    <li>DANE support</li>
	    <li>Security levels (currently experimental in master)</li>
	    <li>OCB</li>
	    <li>FIPS code review and refactor</li>
	    <li>Support for emerging platforms, e.g. ARMv8, POWER8</li>
	    <li>Built-in multi-threaded support for two major threading
	    "flavours," POSIX threads and Win32</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p></p>
